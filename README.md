# rust-for-pythonistas

This repository includes some shortcuts for running the code examples during a live talk.
To enable them, run `source prep`.
This configures your path so that you can do `py <name_of_python_example>` or `rs <name_of_rust_example>` to run examples.
For example, you could run `py ownership` or `rs structs` from the repository's root directory..
