# rust-for-pythonistas

Live demos for my Rust for Pythonistas talk.

Works best in `bash`.
`cd` into the repository and run `source prep` to get ready.
Then, run either `py` (for Python examples) for `rs` (for Rust examples) followed by the filename of the example to run.
For example, `py enums2` will run the demo `rust-for-pythonistas/python/enums2.py`, while `rs enums2` will compile run `rust-for-pythonistas/rust/enums2.rs`.
